          What started as Grandma Rose's secret caramel recipe in our family kitchen 
          has blossomed into a beloved tradition. For over 30 years, we've been 
          handcrafting the perfect caramel apple experience, one bite at a time.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Every apple is hand-selected for its crisp texture, every batch of caramel 
          is made with real butter and cream, and every topping is carefully chosen 
          to create moments of pure joy.
